# Federated-Learning-Based-MDCN-for-Leaf-disease-detection-in-Potato-Plant

## Overview
The Federated Learning-Based Modified Dense Convolutional Network (MDCN) project aims to detect leaf diseases in potato plants. This novel approach leverages federated learning to train models across multiple devices or institutions without the need to centralize data, ensuring data privacy and security. By utilizing advanced deep learning techniques, this model provides accurate and efficient disease detection, helping farmers and agricultural researchers manage and mitigate potato plant diseases effectively.

## Key Features
1. Federated Learning: Utilizes federated learning to train the model across distributed datasets, preserving data privacy and enabling collaborative learning.
2. MDCN Architecture: Implements a Modified Dense Convolutional Network architecture tailored for leaf disease detection, enhancing feature extraction and classification performance.
3. High Accuracy: Achieves high accuracy in detecting various potato plant leaf diseases, validated through extensive testing and evaluation.
4. Privacy-Preserving: Ensures data privacy by keeping data on local devices and only sharing model updates, not the data itself.
5. Scalability: Supports scalability by allowing multiple participants (e.g., farms, research institutions) to collaboratively train the model without sharing raw data.
